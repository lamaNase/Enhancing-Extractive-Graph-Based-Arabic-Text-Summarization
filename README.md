## 🚀 Project Overview

This project addresses the limitations of traditional graph-based summarization methods for Arabic texts by introducing:

1. **Semantic Awareness**  
   - Using advanced sentence embeddings like **FastText** and **AraBERT** to represent sentence meaning.
   - Enhancing graph edge weights with semantic similarity.

2. **Faster Convergence in Ranking**  
   - Leveraging **statistical features** (sentence position, length entropy, etc.) to initialize node scores.
   - This speeds up convergence during TextRank-like ranking processes.

3. **Rich Ranking Techniques**  
   - Traditional & enhanced ranking algorithms:
     - ⚖️ Weighted Degree Centrality  
     - 📏 Degree-Normalized TextRank  
     - 🔄 Symmetric Normalization TextRank  
     - 🧬 Fusion-Based Ranking
